        <h1>My AudiA6 </h1>
        <p>Audi A6 we will be having different models like </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A6</li>
            <li>S6</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The A6 is Audiâ€™s midsize luxury sedan that has been redesigned for the 2019 model year. It gets 335 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque from the 3.0-liter V6 engine. Critics deride the A6 as a boring car bought by German bankers. That reputation is not entirely fair. Nor is it entirely unfair.
The higher performance S6 version ($71,900) upgrades to a 4.0-liter V8 putting out 450 hp and 406 lb-ft of torque. An RS 6 Avant wagon fit for incredibly awesome German bankers is not sold in the U.S.</p>
